This folder contains the materials needed for my HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate: Capstone project submission (MovieLens). These include:

1) The report in Rmd and PDF formats (Report_DSCapstone)

2) The R script needed to construct my model and calculate the RMSE (RScript_DSCapstone.R)

3) The datasets folder, which contains the edx and validation datasets in CSV format. These datasets will be imported in the Rmd report.
