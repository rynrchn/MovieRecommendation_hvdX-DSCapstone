This folder contains the materials needed for my HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate: Capstone project submission (MovieLens). The objective of this project is to construct a movie recommendation system that can predict what rating a particular user would give to a particular movie. The data used is a larger version of the movielens dataset in the dslabs package, with 10 million rows. Our current model has an RMSE of about 0.865.

These files include:

1) The report in Rmd and PDF formats (Report_DSCapstone)

2) The R script needed to construct my model and calculate the RMSE (RScript_DSCapstone.R)
